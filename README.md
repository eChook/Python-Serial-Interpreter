# Python Serial Interpreter
A rudimentary interface to see what data the eChook is generating without the need to connect a phone over bluetooth. 

Primarily for testing purposes, there is no logging capability. If you want to add some, feel free to!

NOTE: Button readings will latch high on the first press of the button - restart the script to reset them.

Enjoy :)

## Dependancies
Python 3.x
tkinter and serial libraries - install through PIP
